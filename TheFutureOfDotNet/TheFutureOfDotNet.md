net fwk 4.8 
- can't reference .net 5
- can reference at max netstandard 2.0

> .NET Standard 2.0 is the highest version of .NET Standard that is supported by .NET Framework

> If you don’t need to support .NET Framework, then you can either go with .NET Standard 2.1 or .NET 5. Most code can
probably skip .NET Standard 2.1 and go straight to .NET 5.
